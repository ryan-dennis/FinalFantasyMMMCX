Should work when downloaded without any extra steps. \n
The game is started by typing "make play," and then the file "gauntlet1.json," \n
which is currently the only valid gauntlet to be played through. \n
The player can then form a party by typing the names of three of the given \n
characters individually and hitting enter after each. After the first battle \n
begins, the valid commands are: fight, drink (potion), magic, cast (spell), \n
and quit. Fight will deal damage; drink is currently not yet implemented and \n
will work (but won't have any effect); magic will give the current attacker's \n
list of spells, and cast (spell) is unimplemented but will deal damage as a \n
placeholder; quit will exit the game. \n
There are three bosses, though only the first is implemented with realistic \n
stats. The player will fight each boss in sequence, then the game will end when \n
the player has defeated all three or all three of their party members have been \n
defeated.
