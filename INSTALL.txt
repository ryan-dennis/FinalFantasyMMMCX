When downloading, create a new empty folder and download src.zip into that folder.
Navigate to that folder in Unix and type "unzip src.zip," then "make play."
The game is started by typing "make play," and then the file "gauntlet1.json," 
which is currently the only valid gauntlet to be played through. 
The player can then form a party by typing the names of three of the given 
characters individually and hitting enter after each (hint: use black belt, he 
is the only character that deals significant damage; this will be balanced later). 
After the first battle begins, the valid commands are: fight, drink (potion), 
magic, cast (spell), and quit. Fight will deal damage; drink is currently not 
yet implemented and will work (but won't have any effect); magic will give the 
current attacker's list of spells, and cast (spell) is unimplemented but will 
deal damage as a placeholder; quit will exit the game. 
There are three bosses, though only the first is implemented with realistic 
stats. The player will fight each boss in sequence, then the game will end when 
the player has defeated all three or all three of their party members have been 
defeated.
