When downloading, create a new empty folder and download src.zip into that
folder.
Navigate to that folder in Unix and type "unzip src.zip," then "make play."
The game is started by typing "make play." The player can then form a party by
typing the names of three of the given characters individually and hitting
enter after each. 
After the first battle begins, the valid commands are: fight, drink (potion), 
magic, cast (spell), pass, and quit. Fight will deal damage; drink (pure/heal)
will have the character drink the relevant potion; magic will give the current
attacker's list of spells; cast (spell) will have the character cast the
given spell (which should match how it is displayed from magic exactly) at the
target that will be prompted for; pass will skip that character's turn
(necessary if they are paralyzed); and quit will exit the game. 
There are three bosses. The player will fight each boss in sequence, then the
game will end when the player has defeated all three or all three of their
party members have been defeated.
